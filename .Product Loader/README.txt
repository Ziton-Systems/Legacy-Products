These scripts have not been adapted to work on their own. 
You are perfectly fine to edit these scripts to work on their own, but
if you do not have much scripting knowledge we do recommend you just use the product module.

Some scripts have been removed from the product loader because they are either still in use, have sensitive information or other redacted reasons.
